## Welcome to Poddy McPodface!

# This isn't a serious thing yet.
I just started it yesterday. I have a todo list, and I'll keep working to make it better,
but until I put up a 'release' (unlikely), you shouldn't use it. Trust me, don't use it. 
I'm not that good of a programmer, this thing is probably broken in all kinds of ways.

If you want to help, send me a message or raise an issue.
